Hi, I’m @Jason-Mittels.
I mainly do game devolpement.
I know C, and some HTML/CSS/JS. I work with SDL2 for graphics and am interested to learn openGL somepoint.
I use linux, but I won't get mad, if you don't ;).
You can reach me at jswmceed@gmail.com. If I don't reply, don't be afraid to sent it again! I have a lot of junkmail.
